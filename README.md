# GamepadConduit

This was an experimental Safari browser extension to provide Gamepad API support
via a native app-extension. While it worked to a degree, the CPU usage of the plugin
process was not encouraging and then Safari added Gamepad support in the
browser itself, making the plugin a moot point.

It was an interesting exercise in creating a Safari extension with native
code and may be of interest to others wanting to make something similar.

Code quality is at prototype level, i.e. not great.
